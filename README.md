# BayesianHPO-BiLSTM
In recent years, Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) have been widely used in cyberattacks, generating random domain names for malicious software communication. Detecting and intercepting these malicious domains in advance has always been a core challenge in the field of cybersecurity. As DGA become increasingly complex, traditional context-based DGA domain classification methods are gradually becoming ineffective. Although generative models can anticipate and generate domains for interception, they struggle to adapt to the changes in different DGA due to the large number of parameters. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian HyperParameter Optimization(HPO)-based BiLSTM model for DGA domain name generation. This method leverages a generative BiLSTM model to predict and generate DGA domain character sequences. By employing Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization, we significantly enhance the efficiency of model parameter tuning, reduce manual intervention, and improve the robustness of the model and the timeliness of the generated domain lists. Experimental results demonstrate that this method exhibits excellent generation accuracy across a wide range of DGA domains.
